						*****************************

Innerve is the annual Tech-Fest of IGDTUW, New Delhi.													
Based on the famous Google summer of code , Innerve  brought it's own version of it - *The Innerve summer of code.* I was  
provide with an open-source coding project. The program was open for all university students.
I had to redesign the project by adding the basic required features and as many additional features as I could to these
existing projects accordingly. Keeping in mind the theme of Innerve this year i.e. "Error 404: Tech Undiscovered". 

### Project  - Innerve SOC Website
--------------------------------
The project consisted of a given template for a tech festâ€™s website. You had to redesign and upgrade the template making the
website as interactive as possible.
